# RESTful Weather API

Demo Node.js App

## Getting Started

This source code is here for CN students if you need something to reference or you think you missed a bit as we went through it. If you'd like to run this application on your local machine you can either clone it, or download the zip file and unpack it + open in VSCode.

You will need to grab your own API keys for both DarkSky.net and MapBox

### Prerequisites

It's worth taking the time to refresh your knowledge of exporting/importing modules, using promises (and Promisify), using async/await, how Express.js works, and the reasons we seperated our methods into their own modules (.js files)

### Installing

Either download the zip file or use the git clone command.

```
Using the terminal:
(navigate to the folder you want to download into)
> git clone this-repository-url
> npm install
> node server.js
(Then direct your browser to localhost:3002)
```

## Tech Reference

JavaScript, Node.js, NPM, Express.js (setting up endpoints and serving static files), Promises, Async/Await, Http requests
