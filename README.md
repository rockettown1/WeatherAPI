# Project Title

Demo Node.js App

## Getting Started

This source code is here for CN students if you need something to reference or you think you missed a bit as we went through it. If you'd like to run this application on your local machine you can either use the clone git command, or download the zip file and unpack it + open in VSCode.

You will need to grab your own API keys for both DarkSky.net and MapBox

### Prerequisites

Once you've got it on your machine, simply run 'npm install' in your terminal to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### Installing

Either download the zip file or use the git clone command.

```
Using the terminal:
(navigate to the folder you want to download into)
> git clone this-repositories-url
> npm install
> node server.js
(Then direct your browser to localhost:3002)
```

## Acknowledgments

This app uses Node.js for the back-end. We use the request module (which we promisified) to get data from two different APIs. We then use the Express.js web framework to create our own web server and RESTful API.
